## Homework # 1

### Combining Global Remote Sensing Products with Hydrological Modelling to Measure the Impact of Tropical Forest Loss on Water-Based Ecosystem Services 
**Journal:** Forests *(20 pages)*


- The Mekong basin presents a huge amount of transformed area. Due the enviromental degradation and a large number of persons in this area, a managment of natural resources is required
- Hydrological modelling allow understand the relationship between forests and water-related ecosystem services
- The most deforest the sub-basins, more changes in surface runoff
