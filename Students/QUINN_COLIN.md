## Title: Guidelines for the use of acoustic indices in environmental research
#### Journal: Methods in Ecology and Evolution
#### Pages: 12
#### Outcomes: 
   * The use of >120 hours of acoustic data results in recorder and other variability to be minimized and the product to reflect variation in soundscapes.
   * Using multiple acoustic indices strnegthens the ability to make inferences on soundscapes, as opposed to using a single index.
   * Findings indicate that there are diel and seasonal patterns in acoustic activity, but not as differentiable variation between different habitat types in the tropics.
