This is a review of current research in the field of abusivie supervision.  I am researching the topic, conducting a new study with one of the PhD's in the Business College.
We are looking at the perception of abusive supervisors across industries.  For example a couple industries with known high levels of abusive are health care and military.  
There are two quotes within this article that indicated the future need for research in the area of cross industry perceptions.
