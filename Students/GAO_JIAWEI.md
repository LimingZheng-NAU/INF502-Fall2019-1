1. Title: *END-TO-END ARGUMENTS IN SYSTEM DESIGN*

2. Venue: ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS)

3. Number of pages: 10 pages

4. Outcomes:

    This paper presents a design principle that helps guide placement of functions among the modules of a distributed computer system.

    This paper proposes a well-known "end-to-end principle" that is designed to help system designers analyze how to choose the proper boundaries between functions and how to place functions into the appropriate layers.
        
    The examples discussed in this article include bit error recovery, using cryptographic security, duplicate message suppression, recovering from system crashes, and passing acknowledgments.
