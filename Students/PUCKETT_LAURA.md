journal: *Ecology*

Number of pages: 8

3 outcomes:
* frequency of northeastern temperature tree species was more related to climate gradients than relative abundance 
* relative abundance was nearly constant up until the edge of the climate range of a species
* the range of climates where a species was common was narrow
