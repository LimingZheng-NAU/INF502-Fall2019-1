i. Out-of-sample performance is evaluated over a test set consisting of 72 images for both the template matching scheme and the support 
vector classier.
ii. The template matching system has a pedestrian detection rate of 52.7%, with a false positive rate of 1 for
every 5,000 windows examined.
iii. The success of sucha straightforward template matching measure suggests that the template learning scheme extracts non-trivial 
structural regularity within the pedestrian class.
